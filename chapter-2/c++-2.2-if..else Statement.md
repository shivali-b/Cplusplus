# if..else Statement  

As we have seen in the previous tutorial that certain block of code is executed if the boolean condition of **if statement** returns true otherwise the first line after the if block is executed if the boolean expression returns false.  

In this tutorial, we will see that we can insert the optional **else statement** which can be executed if the boolean expression returns false.  

## Syntax  
```c++
if(boolean_expression) {
   statement(s); //will be execute if the boolean expression is true
} else {
  statement(s); //will be execute if the boolean expression is false
}
```
### Explanation of code 

If the boolean expression returns true then if block will be executed otherwise else block will be executed.  

## Example 
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 5;
 
   // check the boolean condition
   if( a < 3 ) {
      // if condition is true then following is executed 
      cout << "a is less than 3;" << endl;
   } else {
      // if condition is false then following is executed 
      cout << "a is not less than 3;" << endl;
   }
   cout << "value of a is : " << a << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of code  

Here variable 'a' holds value 5. Now the boolean expression is checked and it returns false as therefore the if block is skipped and else block executed.

## Output
```c++
a is not less than 3;
value of a is : 5
``` 

# if..else if Statement

When there is the situation to test multiple conditions which multiple blocks of code than **if..else if** statement is used.  
In this statement once any of the else if statement is executed after the condition becomes true then none of the other conditions will be checked and the program will come out of the entire block of code.  
If none of the else if condition becomes true than at last the else block will be executed and the program will come out of the block of code.

## Syntax  
```c
if(boolean_expression 1) {
   // if boolean expression 1 is true then following is executed 
} else if( boolean_expression 2) {
   // if boolean expression 2 is true then following is executed 
} else if( boolean_expression 3) {
   // if boolean expression 3 is true then following is executed 
} else {
   // executes when the none of the above condition is true.
}
```  

## Example  

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 50;
 
   // check the boolean condition
   if( a == 5 ) {
      // if condition is true then following is executed
      cout << "Value of a is 5" << endl;
   } else if( a == 15 ) {
      // when else if condition is true following is executed
      cout << "Value of a is 15" << endl;
   } else if( a == 50 ) {
      // when else if condition is true following is executed
      cout << "Value of a is 50" << endl;
   } else {
      // when none of the conditions is true following is executed
      cout << "Value of a is not matching" << endl;
   }
   cout << "Exact value of a is : " << a << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
```  
### Explanation of code  
In the above code the if condition checks whether the value of a is 50 or not and keep checking all the condition. If none of the condition returns true then it performs else statement and terminate the block of code.  

## Output 
```
Value of a is 50
Exact value of a is : 50
```
