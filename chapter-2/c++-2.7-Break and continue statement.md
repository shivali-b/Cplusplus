# Break and Continue Statement  

## Break statement
When **Break statement** is used inside the loop, the loop immediately terminates the program and the flow of control jumps to the first line after the loop.  
Also, the break statement is used in the switch statement to get out of it when the condition is matched.  

## Syntax  
```c++
break;
```

## Example  
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 5;

   while( a < 10 ) {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a = a + 1;
      if( a > 7) {
         // terminate the if loop
         break;
      }
   } 
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of code  

Here the variable 'a' holds value 5. Now the while loop condition checks whether 'a < 10' and print the value of 'a' until the condition returns true. Here the if condition is nested with while loop which shows condition 'a > 7' and when the condition returns true it will terminate the entire loop.  

## Output  

```c++
value of a: 5
value of a: 6
value of a: 7
```  

## Continue Statement  

The **Continue statement** works just like break statement but the only difference is that the break statement terminates the entire loop while the continue statement **terminates the current iteration inside the loop** and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.  

## Syntax 

```c++
continue;
```  

## Example  

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 5;

   // do loop execution
   while( a < 10 ){
      if( a == 7) {
         // skip this iteration.
         a = a + 1;
         continue;
      }
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a = a + 1;
   } 
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of code

Here the variable 'a' holds value 5. Now the while loop condition checks whether 'a < 10' and print the value of 'a' until the condition returns true. Here the if condition is nested with while loop which shows condition 'a > 7' and when the condition returns true it will terminate the current iteration and again jumps to check the while condition for next iteration.  


## Output

```c++
value of a: 5
value of a: 6
value of a: 8
value of a: 9
```
