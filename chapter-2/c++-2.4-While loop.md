# While loop  

As we have checked a certain block of code is executed if the **if statement** condition returns true.  
But in if statement the block of code inside the if statement is executed only once if the condition returns true.  
But in many cases, the block of code is to be executed more than one time in the programming.  
In such cases, **Loops** can be useful. **While loop** is one such loop.  

In a while loop, the block of code is executed as long as the condition returns true.  

## Syntax  
```c++
while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}
```
Here the statement refers to anyone statement or multiple blocks of code.  
If the condition returns false then the immediate line after the while loop is executed.  

## Example  
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 5;

   // while loop execution
   while( a < 10 ) {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a++;
   }
 
   return 0;
}
```  
### Explanation of code  

In the above code, the variable 'a' holds 5. Now while loop condition checks whether the 'a' is less than 10 and as soon as the 'a' will be greater than 10 it will terminate the loop.

## Output
```c
value of a:5
value of a:6
value of a:7
value of a:8
value of a:9
```
