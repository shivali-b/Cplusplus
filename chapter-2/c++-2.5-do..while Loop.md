# do..while LOOP  

The do..while loop is just like while loop except that the do..while is guaranteed to execute at least once. Also for this type of output the condition of do..while loop is checked at the bottom of the loop.  

## Syntax

```c++
do {
   statement(s);
} 
while( condition );  
```
## Explanation of code  
As we can see in the above code that the condition is checked at the end of the loop therefore the loop is at least performed one time even if the condition returns false. Further, the loop is executed until the condition returns false.  

## Example
```c++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 5;

   // do loop execution
   do {
      cout << "value of a: " << a << endl;
      a = a + 1;
   } while( a < 10 );
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of code  

In the above code variable, 'a' holds value 5. Then we use do..while loop and print the value of 'a' until the while loop condition becomes false.  

## Output  
```c++
value of a: 5
value of a: 6
value of a: 7
value of a: 8
value of a: 9
```
