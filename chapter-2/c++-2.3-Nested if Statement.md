# Nested is Statement   

Rather than using if..else if statement it is always better convince to use **Nested if Statement**.  
Nested if statement is nothing but **if statement inside other if statement**.  

## Syntax  
```c++
if( boolean_expression 1) {
   // if boolean expression 1 is true then following is executed 
   if(boolean_expression 2) {
      // if boolean expression 2 is true then following is executed 
   }
}
```
### Explanation of code  
In the above code firstly the first if statement is executed if the boolean expression 1 returns true and then inside it the boolean expression 2 is checked.  
If the boolean expression 1 returns false then the entire block of code is terminated and the boolean expression 2 is not checked.  

## Example  
```c++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 10;
   int b = 20;
 
   // check the boolean condition
   if( a == 10 ) {
      // when condition is true then check the following is executed
      if( b == 20 ) {
         // when condition is true then print the following is executed
         cout << "Value of a is 10 and b is 20" << endl;
      }
   }
   cout << "Exact value of a is : " << a << endl;
   cout << "Exact value of b is : " << b << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
```
### Explanation of code   

In the above example, we can see that 'a' holds 10 and 'b' holds 20. Now first the if condition checks whether 'a' holds 10 or not and it returns true therefore the other condition is checked whether 'b' holds 20 for not. Further, it returns true and hence the statements inside the block are executed.  

## Output  
```
Value of a is 10 and b is 20
Exact value of a is : 10
Exact value of b is : 20
```
