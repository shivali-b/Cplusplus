# if Statement  

There comes point in programming where some specific statement is to be executed if the certain condition becomes true.  
**if statement** helps us to perform such a task.  
An **if** statement consists of the boolean expression and if that expression returns true then the block of code inside it is executed.   

## Syntax:

```c++
if(boolean_expression) {
   statement(s);  // will be execute if the boolean expression is true
}
```  
### Explanation of code:  
If the boolean expression in brackets after if keyword returns true then the block of code inside it will be executed and if it returns false then the line after the completion of if statement will be executed.  

## Example:  

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   
   int a = 5;
 
   // check the boolean condition
   if( a < 10 ) {
      // if condition is true then print the following
      cout << "a is less than 10;" << endl;
   }
   cout << "value of a is : " << a << endl;
 
   return 0;
```
### Explanation of code:  

Here we variable 'a' holds value 5. Now the condition of if statement checks if **a<10** and it is true therefore the code inside the bracket is executed. After the block is executed the next line immediately after the if statement is executed. 

## Output of the code:  
```c++
a is less than 10;
value of a is : 5
```
