# sizeof() Operator   

**sizeof()** is the keyword, but it is the compile-time operator used to know the size of the variable or data type.  
In C/C++, have the minimum size for basic data type as follow:  

|    Catagory    |  Data Type  | Minimum Size |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
|    Boolean     |     bool    |    1 byte    |
|    Character   |     char    |    1 byte    |
|     Integer    |    short    |    2 bytes |
|                |     int     |    2 bytes |
|                |     long    |    4 bytes |
|                |  long long  |    8 bytes |
| Floating Point |    float    |    4 bytes |
|                |    double   |    8 bytes |
|                | long double |    8 bytes |  

## Syntax

```c++
sizeof (data type)
```
## Example  

```c++
cout << "char: " << sizeof(char) << endl;
cout << "int: " << sizeof(int) << endl;
cout << "float: " << sizeof(float) << endl;
cout << "double: " << sizeof(double) << endl;
int var = 50;
cout << "var: " << sizeof(var) << endl;
```

## Output

```c++
char: 1
int: 4
float: 4
double: 8
var: 4
```
In C/C++, the sizeof() operator is also used to identify the size of the array.  

## Example  

```c++
int Arr[5];
cout << sizeof(Arr) << endl; 
```
## Output  

```c++
40
```
Here we know that double is of size 8 bytes and combining 5 double value in the array it will take the size of total 40 bytes.  

Note that the output value of sizeof() operator may vary according to computer and compiler used.
