# Virtual Function  

The **virtual function** is a function in the base class created by the keyword **virtual** and redefined in the derived class. 

While invoking the object in the derived class, using a pointer or a reference to the base class you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class version of the function.   

The virtual function helps to know that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the time of the pointer used to call the function.  

These functions are mainly used to achieve the **Runtime polymorphism**.  

## Rules for Virtual Function  

1. The virtual function cannot be friend function or the static function of another class.  

2. The virtual function should be accessed using the reference of base class type to achieve run time polymorphism.  

3. The prototype of the virtual class should be the same in both base and derived class.  

4. A class may have **virtual destructor** but it does not have a virtual constructor. 

## Example  

```c++
class Fruit {
 public:
  virtual void col() {
  }
};

class Orange: public Fruit {
 public:
  void col() {
   cout << "Orange!"<<endl;
  }
};

class Apple: public Fruit {
 public:
  void col() {
   cout << "Apple!"<<endl;
 }
};
```
Every derived class will override the col() function and has a separate implementation.  

Now we can use the "Fruit" pointer to call the "col()" function.  

```c++
int main() {
  Orange o;
  Apple a;
  Fruit *f1 = &o;
  Fruit *f2 = &a;

  f1->col();
  f2->col();
}
```
## Output 

```c++
Orange!
Apple!
```

Note that the class that declares or inherits a Virtual Function is called **Polymorphic Class**
