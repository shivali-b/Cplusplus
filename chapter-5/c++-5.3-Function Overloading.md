# Function Overloading  

Function Overloading allows creating multiple functions with the same name but a different number of parameters and different types of parameters.  

For Example, we need sum function to print the sum of two integer values as well as two floating values. For this purpose, we need to define the function with the parameters having integer data type as well as a float data type.  
In such a condition, the function overloading occurs.  

## Example 

```c++
int sum (int a, int b){
    int result;

    result = a + b;

    return result;
}
```  
```c++
int sum (float a, float b){
    float result;

    result = a + b;

    return result;
}
```  

Now the same "sum" function will work for both integer and float value according to the parameter passed.  

Note that we **can not overload the function by differing the return** type of the function. **Function overloading only occurs when the parameter list has differed** in the function definition.  

## Example  

```c++
int printNo(int a){}
float printNo(int b){}
double printNo(int c){}
```  
The above declaration of function as function overloading results in error.  

# Example 

```c++
int sum (int a, int b){
    int result;

    result = a + b;

    return result;
}

int sum (float a, float b){
    float result;

    result = a + b;

    return result;
}

void main(){

    int ret;

    int a = 2;
    int b = 3;
    int x = 2.1;
    int y = 4.2;

    c = sum(a,b);
    d = sum(x,y);

    cout << "sum is : " << c << endl;
    cout << "sum is : " << d << endl;

}
```
## Output  

```c++
sum is : 5
sum is : 6.3
```
