# Two Dimensional Array   

Two-dimensional array/2D array in C/C++ is the simplest form of multi-dimensional array. 2D array can be also interpreted as a table containing columns and rows.  

## Syntax  

A 2D array is declared with the data type of the elements along with the array name and arraySize. Here the array size are declared twice, one indicating the size of the row and size of the column.  

```c++
datatype arrayName[rowSize][columneSize]
```
Here the data type is any valid C/C++ data type and the row size and columnSize must be any integral number greater than zero.  

## For Example
```c++
int a[2][3];
```
The above syntax shows the declaration of a 2D array with datatype integer and rowSize as '2' and column size as '3'.  

## Initialization of 2D Array  

In C/C++, 2D array can be initialized as follow:

```c++
int a[2][3] = {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6}
}; 
```
It can also be written as below:

```c++
int a[2][3] = { {3, 2, 6}, {4, 5, 20} }; 
```  
## Accessing the 2D Array  

For printing the 2D array we need both row size and column size. The pictorial representation for 3 rows and 4 column as goes:

|      | column1 | column2 | column3 | column4 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| row1 | x [0][0] | x [0][1] | x [0][2] | x [0][3] |
| row2 | x [1][0] | x [1][1] | x [1][2] | x [1][3] |
| row3 | x [2][0] | x [2][1] | x [2][2] | x [2][3] |


## For Example 

```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std; 
main( ) 
{  
    int arr[2][3] = {
       {1, 2, 3},
       {4, 5, 6}
    }; 
         
    int i,j;
     
    cout<<"Printing a 2D Array:\n";
    for(i=0;i<2;i++)
    {
        for(j=0;j<3;j++)
        {
            cout<<"\t"<<arr[i][j];
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
```
### Explanation of code 

In the above code, we first initialize the 2D array as 'arr[2][3]'.  
After that, we access the array element using for loop. Here the first loop with iteration of 'i' represents the row elements and the inner loop with 'j' iteration represents the column elements.  
When we nest both the loop it will access the element of the 2D array.  

## Output  

```c++
Printing a 2D Array:
1 2 3
4 5 6
```
