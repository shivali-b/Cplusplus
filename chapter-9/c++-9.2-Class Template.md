# Class Templates  

Just like the function template, we have **class template** which permits the classes to have members that use template parameters as types.  

## Syntax  

```c++
template <class T>
class MyClass {

};
```
Similar to function templates, we can define more than one generic data type by using a **comma-separated list**.

## Example  

```c++
template <class T>
class MyClass {
 private:
  T first, second;
 public:
  MyClass (T x, T y):
   first(x), second(y) {
  }
};

```
Here in the above code, we declare a class template "Class", with 2 private variables of a generic type, and a constructor that initialize the variables.  

In case you define the member function outside the class for example in the source file, a specific syntax is required in this case.  

Note that we need to define the generic type inside the **angle brackets** after the class name.  

## Example  

```c++
template <class T>
class MyClass {
 private:
  T first, second;
 public:
  MyCLass (T x, T y):
   first(x), second(y){
  }
  T small();
};

template <class T>
T MyClass<T>::small() {
  return (first<second ? first : second);
}
}
```

Here in the above example, we have the member function "small()" outside the class. Therefore the above specific syntax is required in case we define the member function outside the class.  

Here the "small()" function returns the value of the small member variable. The ternary operator compares both the variable and returns the smaller one.  

To create the object of template class for the different data types, we need to specify the data type in the **angle brackets** just like defining the function outside the class.

## Example  

```c++
MyClass <int> obj(11, 22);
cout << obj.small();
```
## Output 

```c++
11
```
