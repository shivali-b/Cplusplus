# Working With Files  

The best feature of C++ programming is the ability to read and write files. This feature requires the standard library named **fstream**.  

Three data types are defined in fstream:  

1. **ofstream**: Output file streams that create files and allows them to write information in it.  

2. **ifstream**: Input file stream which allows us to read information from files.  

3. **fstream**: The file stream allows us to create, read and write information in the file. It is the combination of "ofstream" and "ifstream".  

For file processing purposes we need both **iostream** and **fstream** standard library in the source file.  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
```
We have already used the objects of this standard library i.e cin: object of "istream" for data input and cout: object of "ostream" for data output.  

Before reading and writing in the file, we need to **open the file**. Either "ofstream" or "fstream" can be used to open the file.  

## Example 

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ofstream MyFiles;
  MyFiles.open("text.txt");

  MyFiles << "Some text. \n";
}

```
Here we open the file called "text.txt" and write some content in it.   
The above code creates an "ofstream" object called "MyFiles", and uses the **open()** function to open the "text.txt" file. 

Note that if the specified file does not exist then the "open()" will **automatically creates it**.  

When the working with the file is over, it is mandatory to close the file with **close()** function.  

## Example  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ofstream MyFiles;
  MyFiles.open("text.txt");

  MyFiles << "Some text! \n";
  MyFiles.close();
}

```

We can also provide the path to the file using "ofstream" object constructor, instead of invoking the "open()" function.  

## Example  

```c++
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ofstream MyFiles("text.txt");

  MyFiles << "This is awesome! \n";
  MyFiles.close();
}

```
Along with the "open()" function we can provide the path of the file located in a different directory.  

For example, you do not have file permission, then under such condition, the **"open()" function will fail.**
So **is_open()** function is used to check whether the file is opened or not.  

## Example  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  ofstream MyFiles("text.txt");

  if (MyFiles.is_open()) {
   MyFiles << "This is awesome! \n";
  }
  else {
   cout << "Something went wrong";
  }
  MyFiles.close();
}

```  

An optional second parameter of the "open" function declares the **modes** in which the files are opened.  

The following table shows the mode of the file:

|     Mode    |                   Meaning                  |
|:-----------:|:------------------------------------------:|
|   ios::app  |            append to end of file           |
|   ios::ate  |    after opening it goes to end of file    |
| ios::binary |          file opens in binary mode         |
|   ios::in   |         file opens for reading only        |
|   ios::out  |         file opens for writing only        |
|  ios::trunc | delete the content of the file if existing |

All this can be combined using **bitwise OR(|) operator**.  
For example, in the case to open the file and truncate it the following is the method.  

```c++
ofstream outfile;
outfile.open("file.dat", ios::out | ios::trunc );
```
We can read the information from the file using the "ifstream" or "fstream" object.  

## Example  

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  string line;
  ifstream MyFiles("text.txt");
  while ( getline (MyFiles, line) ) {
   cout << line << '\n';
  }
  MyFiles.close();
}
```
The **getline()** function helps to read the characters from an input stream and places them into a string specified.
