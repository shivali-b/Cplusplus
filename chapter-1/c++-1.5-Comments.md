# Comments   

Many a times it difficult and tedious for understanding the code written by someone else program.  
Therefore comments are the **explanatory statements** which helps understanding the code.  
The characters inside the comment are ignored by compiler during compilation. 
Every programming language has methods of comments.  

C++ has 2 types comments:
* Single line comment
* Double line comment

## Single line comment   

C++ single line comment starts with **//** and extend to the end of line.  
For Example:  
```c
// This is comment 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

main() {

     cout << "Hello"; // prints Hello 
   
   return 0;
}
```  
While compiling the program, compiler ignores the comment and execute the rest of the program.  
Output of the above program will be:
```c
Hello
```  
## Multi line comment   

C++ multi-line comment starts with **/*** and ends with ***/**.  
For Example:
```c
/* This is comment
Below code prints hello */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

main() {
   cout << "Hello"; 
   
   return 0;
}
```  
Also both of the comments can be nested into one another. 
For example:

```c
/* Comment out printing of Hello World:

cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World

*/
```
