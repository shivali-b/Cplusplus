# Operators  

Operators are the special symbols that helps the compiler to perform some specific mathematical or logical operations.  
Following are the types of operator present in C++ language.

* Arithmetic Operator
* Relational Operator
* Logical Operator
* Bitwise Operator
* Assignment Operator 
* Misc Operator 

Now let us understand the above operator in detail.

## Arithmetic Operator  

Suppose  variable A = 2 and variable B = 4 then following operations are hold by arithmetic operator:

| Operator |                          Description                          |  Example | Example Output |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------:|:--------------:|
|     +    | Adds   two operands                                           | A   + B  |       6       |
|     -    | Subtracts   second operand from the first                     | A   - B  |       -2      |
|     *    | Multiplies   both operands                                    | A   * B  |       8      |
|     /    | Divides   numerator by denominator                           | B   / A  |        2       |
|     %    | Modulus   Operator and remainder of after an integer division | B   % A  |        0       |
|    ++    | Increment operator, increases integer value   by one          |   A++    |       3       |
|    --    | Decrement operator, decreases integer value   by one          |    A--   |        1       | 

## Relational Operator  

Suppose  variable A = 10 and variable B = 20 then following operations are hold by relational operator:  

| **Operator** |                                                 **Description**                                                 |      **Example**     |
|--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| ==           | Checks if the value of both variable is equal or not. If yes than returns true otherwise false                  | A == B is not true |
| !=           | Check if the value of both variable is equal or not. If not than returns true otherwise false                   | A != B is true     |
| <            | Checks if value of the left variable is small than right. If yes than return true otherwise false               | A < B is true      |
| >            | Checks if value of the left variable is greater than right. If yes than returns true otherwise false            | A > B is not true  |
| <=           | Checks if value of the left variable is smaller than or equal to right. If yes than return true otherwise false | A <= B is true     |
| >=           | Check if value of the left variable is greater than or equal to right. If yes than return true otherwise false  | A >= B is not true |  

## Logial Operator   

Following logical operator are supported by C++:
Suppose variable A hold 1 and variable B holds 0 than

| **Operator** | **Description**                                                                                                                                   | **Example**        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
|      &&      | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true otherwise false.                                                      | A && B is false  |
|     \|\|     | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true otherwise false.                                                  | A \|\| B is true |
|       !      | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false and if true than it will make it false. | !(A && B) is true  |  

## Bitwise Operator 

Bit Operator perform operation **bit by bit**. 

Assume if A = 8 and B = 10  

A = 1000
B = 1010

A&B = 1000
A|B = 1010
A^B = 0010
~A = 0001

Below are the bitwise operator supported by C++ language.  
Assume A=10 and B=20  
A = 0000 1010  
B = 0001 0010

| \|       | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if any of the one operand have it.                                                           | (A \| B) will give 26 which is 0001 1010                                                     |
| ^        | Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is in only one operand and not in both.                                              | (A ^ B) will give 24 which is 0001 1000                                                      |
| ~        | Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and flip the bit.                                           | (~A ) will give -117 which is 1111 0101 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number. |
| <<       | Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.   | A << 2 will give 40 which is 0010 1000                                                      |
| >>       | Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. | A >> 2 will give 2 which is 0000 0010                                                       |

For Example:  
Assume if A = 8 and B = 10    

A = 1000  
B = 1010  

A&B = 1000  
A|B = 1010  
A^B = 0010  
~A = 0001

## Operator precedence in C++  

More than one expression is used in many expression. In such condition it becomes difficult to evaluate the expression. Therefore the operators are classified in some terms and group according to which such type of expression can be solved. 

Here the following tables shows the operators with higher precedence above and according to this the expression should be evaluated.

|     Category     |              Operator              | Associativity  |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------:|:--------------:|

|      Unary       |  + - ! ~ ++ - - (type)* & sizeof   | Right to left  |
| Multiplicative   |               * / %                | Left to right  |

```c++
Live Demo
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
main() {
   int a = 5;
   int b = 10;
   int c = 2;
   int d = 3;
   int e;
 
   e = (a + b) * c / d;      // ( 15 * 2 ) / 3
   cout << "Value of (a + b) * c / d is :" << e << endl ;

   return 0;
```

Output:

```c++
Value of (a + b) * c / d is :10
```
