# Data Types  

While programming we need something to store the data and information which can further be used during program execution. In C/C++ Language we use variables in programs to store data during execution.
Therefore there are many types of data type according to which we store the data in the variable.  
Following are the types of data types and their corresponding keyword, description and format specifier:

|          Type         | Keyword |                                   Description                                    | Format Specifier  |
|:---------------------:|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|        Boolean        |   bool  |                         Represents True and False Value                         |         -         |
|       Character       |   char  |                       Represents Single English Character                       |         %c        |
|        Integer        |   int   |                             Represents Whole Number                             |         %d        |
|     Floating point    |  float  |  Represents the numeric value with decimal point having precision upto 6 digits |         %f        |
| Double floating point |  double | Represents the numeric value with decimal point having precision upto 15 digits |         %d        |
|       Valueless       |   void  |                            Does not return any value                            |         %p        |

The format specifier in C/C++ language is used for input and output purpose. It helps the compiler to know which type of data type is in the variable to read while input and to be printed while output.  


Several of them can be modified using the following type modifier:  

* signed
* unsigned
* short
* long  

## Character Type and Integer Type   

As mentioned before Integer is a **Whole Number** and Character is a **English Alphabet**.
The following table provides the data of the all the  character type and integer type storage size and its ranges:

|     Type      | Storage size  | Range                                                |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|------------------------------------------------------|
|      char     |    1 byte     |                -128 to 127 or 0 to 255               |
| unsigned char |    1 byte     |                       0 to 255                       |
|  signed char  |    1 byte     |                      -128 to 127                     |
|      int      |  2 or 4 byte  | -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| unsigned int  |  2 or 4 byte  |           0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295          |
|     short     |    2 byte     |                   -32,768 to 32,767                  |
|   unsigned    |     2 byte    |                      0 to 65,535                     |
|     long      |    8 byte     |       -922337203684775808 to 92233720364775807       |
|   unsigned    |     8 byte    |               0 to 18446744073709551615              |


Here above as we can see that the range of Character data type is in numerical form even if it represents the Alphabets. The reason behind it is that the English Characters are understood by us but not by Computer systems as computer only understands the Binary language.  

Therefore the characters are basically converted into the numeric form by rules of ASCII( American Standard Code for Information Interchange) for computer systems. Hence the range of character data type is also in numeric form.

## Example of Integer Type:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 3;
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}
```  

### Explanation of code
In the above code, ‘a' is declared as a variable with a data type 'int’ so it stores integer value in it.
The print statement contains 2 arguments. The first argument is **"%d"** which is format specifier.  
The second argument **"a"** is the variable to be printed which we declared before.  
The output of the above example program:
```c
3
``` 
## Example of Character type:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char a = 's';
    printf("%c", a);
    return 0;
}
```
Output of the above code is as below :
```c
s
```
### Explanation of code
In the above code 'a' declared as an variable with data type 'char' and store value in it. Note that while storing the variable in char, the value is defined in between the quotes ('').    
In this example the format specifier used is **"%c"** because the data type is char.  

 ## Float Point and Double Float Point  

Floating Point type is an **Real Number**.
As noted the floating point value have precision upto 6 decimal digits while double point value have precision upto 15 decimal digits.
Long Double type value give higher precision than Double point but eventually the precision upto double point is practically used.
The following table provides the data of floating type and double type storage size and range.  

 |     Type     | Storage size |          Range         |
|:------------:|:------------:|:----------------------:|
|     float    |    4 byte    |   1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38   |
|    double    |    8 byte    |  2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308  |
| long double  |    10 byte   | 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932 | 

Example for floating data type:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float a = 2.4;
    printf("%f", a);
    return 0;
}
```  
### Explanation of code
In the above example the format specifier used is **"%f"** because the data type is float. It will be **%d** for double data type and **%ld** for long double data type.  

Output of the above example:
```c
2.4
```

## Valueless Type  

The valueless type or void type specifies that no value is available. It can be possible in following situations:

1. Function return as void   
There are many functions that do not return any value. Parameter type would be void.

2. Function argument as void  
There are many function in C which do not accept any parameter. Therefore the function with no parameter can be known as void.  

3. Pointer as void  
A pointer of type void * represents the address of an object, but not its type.
