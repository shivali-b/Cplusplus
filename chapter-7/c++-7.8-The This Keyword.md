# The **THIS** Keyword  

Every object in C++ has its own address by an important pointer called the **this** pointer.   
Inside the member function **this** is used during the invoking object.  

```c++
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(int a) : var(a)
  { }
 private:
  int var;
};

```

As friends are not members of the class, **Friend function** does not have **this** pointer.  

The **printInfo()** method presents three alternatives for printing the variable of the class.  

```c++
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(int a) : var(a)
  { }
  void printInfo() {
   cout << var<<endl;
   cout << this->var<<endl;
   cout << (*this).var<<endl; 
  }
 private:
  int var;
};
```

All the above three alternatives to print the variable will give the same results.  

## Example  

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(int a) : var(a)
  { }
  void printInfo() {
   cout << var <<endl;
   cout << this->var <<endl;
   cout << (*this).var <<endl; 
  }
 private:
  int var;
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj(4);
  obj.printInfo();
}
```  

Here in the above code, note that only the member function has **this** pointer.  

## Output  

```c++
4
4
4
```
