# Constructor  

Constructors are a special member of the class. They are executed whenever the new object is created.  

The constructor has the same name as the **Class name**. It also ** does not have any return type, not even void**.

## Example  

```c++
class myClass {
  public:
    myClass() {
      cout <<"Hi";
    }
    void setName(string x) {
      name = x;
    }
    string getName() {
      return name;
    }
  private:
    string name;
};

int main() {
  myClass myObj;

  return 0;
}

```
In the above code the method printing "Hi" is the constructor of the class. So when the object is created the constructor is **automatically called**.  

## Output  

```c++
Hi
```
For setting the initial value of the member variables, Constructors play the most important role. Constructors **do not have parameter** as default. However, the parameters can be **added according to requirement**.  

```c++
class myClass {
  public:
    myClass(string nm) {
      setName(nm);
    }
    void setName(string x) {
      name = x;
    }
    string getName() {
      return name;
    }
  private:
    string name;
};
```
Here we define the constructor with parameter and assign the "name" attribute using the "setName()" method.
