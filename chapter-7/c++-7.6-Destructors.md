# Destructors  

Just like a constructor is a special function called when the object is created. 

Similarly, **destructors** are special functions called when the object is destroyed or deleted.  
Objects are destroyed whenever they go out of scope.  

The name of the destructor will be the same as a class but prefixed by **~(tilde)**. Also, the destructor do not take any parameter and can not return value.  

## Syntax  

```c++
class MyClass {
  public: 
    ~MyClass() {
     // block of code
    }
};
```
Destructors are very useful for releasing resources before coming out of the program.  

Now lets declare a destructor for our "MyClass" class in its **header file MyClass.h**:  
After that we can implement the source code in the source file of **MyClass.cpp**:

```c++
#include "MyClass.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

MyClass::MyClass()
{
  cout<<"Constructor"<<endl;
}

MyClass::~MyClass()
{
  cout<<"Destructor"<<endl;
}
```
As we know destructors cannot take the parameters they **cannot be overloaded**. Also, it is **not mandatory to use** destructor but remember that every class can have **only one destructor**.
